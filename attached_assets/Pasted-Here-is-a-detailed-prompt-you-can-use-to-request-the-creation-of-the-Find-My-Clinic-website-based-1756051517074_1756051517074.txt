### **Website Creation Prompt for "Find My Clinic"**

**Project Title:** Website for "Find My Clinic" - A Real-Time Clinic Queue Management Platform

**Project Overview:**
We need a professional, user-friendly website for "Find My Clinic," a platform designed to solve the problem of long, uncertain wait times at local clinics. The website will serve as the primary online presence for the service, catering to two main audiences: **Patients** looking for nearby clinics and **Clinics** wanting to digitize and manage their patient flow. The core mission is to bridge the information gap in local healthcare by providing a real-time, map-first platform that makes the process of visiting a clinic more efficient and less stressful for everyone involved.

[cite_start]**Core Slogan:** "In need of care? We'll get you there." [cite: 2, 120]

**Target Audience:**
1.  **Patients:** Individuals seeking medical care at local clinics who want to avoid long wait times and have a more predictable and less stressful experience.
